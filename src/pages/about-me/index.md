|I've started this website as a blog a few years ago. Even I don't blog too often, it's better than nothing.

|_Me_, the TLDR version:
|
|I have worked as a Software Engineer, doing Front-end and Back-end (JS, Java, .NET), then Data Engineer (Scala, Kafka, Hadoop, GCP).
|
|In 2018, I decided to be self-employed, doing freelance and consultant work mostly related to data engineering, because I love data!

You can [check it out](http://amzn.eu/iOQIowS) and [buy me one](http://amzn.eu/iOQIowS) if you want! :sunglasses:
