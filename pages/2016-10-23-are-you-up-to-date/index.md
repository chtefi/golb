A few weeks ago, I've created a repo on github resuming how I stay up to date with the technology: [chtefi/how-i-stay-updated](https://github.com/chtefi/how-i-stay-updated). I thought it would be nice to write a blog post on that, for you to find it, and for me to go a bit more deeper. I'll start explaining my situation in the IT world, why I follow all the things I'm following, then I'll list of the resources I'm using to stay up-to-date so you could get some ideas. ;-) 

> Feel free to comment about what YOU are using to stay up-to-date. I'm eagerly impatient to know.

# Frontend, backend, what's the difference?

Those days, I'm working as a back-end and bigdata guy. Before that, I did a lot of front-end, so I also keep my front-end knowledge up to date. It's still helpful to help and talk with the frontend teams, and it's always useful when I want some quick UI to simplify my workflow. I even did a repo where I put everything I know about [how to write a good website](https://github.com/chtefi/making-a-website). Don't hesitate to PR ! I may be a little rusty over some things. As I was working mostly on the frontend side (and some backend but nothing fancy), [I was bored and wanted to try something new](http://ctheu.com/2015/05/09/then-suddenly/). Reading all those news and stuff about bigdata made me wanting to go there and see what was the deal with that. I've challenged myself, decided to resign of my current job (5 years there), and found a job in an amazing company in Paris, [Powerspace](http://powerspace.com/). The boss was kind enough to let me in, despite the fact I don't had a lot of experiences with their current stack. He accepted the challenge, because he knew I was able to learn quickly and that I definitely wanted to learn, making me a good resource. 

> Being good is being a good learner.

There is also this version: being an engineer (what most of us are considered today in IT) is being confortable with the ongoing changes and evolutions. I was, and he trusted me. Anyway, it's been a year, and now, I have a way better knowledge of the available backend technologies we can use, how to use and link them, understand why they exist. I also like working on the architecture side thanks to the bigdata constraints. Then finally, I'm caring a lot more about the monitoring and alerting piece, those are truly something to be taken into account to know what's going on each second in your company heart. Working in the IT domain, you probably know Continuous Delivery, Continuous Integration, so you must be aware of the Continuous Learning. Here are the resources I'm using to do that. 

# Twitter

Of course. It's rare that tech people don't have a twitter. This is often where the things happen at first. It's an incredible source of informations. The characters limit is like a continuous TLDR feed, because we don't have time to read everything. We just want to be aware it exists, and refer to it when we need to. We don't know if Twitter is still going to be there in 10 years. I sometimes wonder how we were doing before that. :-) I'm posting a lot of links myself, everything I find interesting, don't hesitate to say hi and follow me for your Continous Learning!

# Chrome

My "new tab" is using [tabbie](https://tabbie.io/) since it was created. I never removed it even if it's not perfect. It always answered to my needs, so, why change? I'm using: 

  * github: [best daily starred repos](https://github.com/trending). I often discover nice repo with this.
  * reddit: [#programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/) [#react](https://www.reddit.com/r/react/) [#javascript](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/) [#scala](https://www.reddit.com/r/scala/). I click when i see an interesting title.
  * hackernews: often interesting topics and links. I go to the main website too, to read the [best of HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/best).
  * dribbble: because designers are doing [cool stuff](https://dribbble.com/) :-)

# Bookmarks

I have a special folder "TO READ" where I bookmark for later. Months ago, I was able to be stable around 10. Right now, I have like >100 links in this folder. Always read some on evenings. Once, I tried [pocket](https://getpocket.com/), but, for some reason, I didn't like it and stayed with my manual method. There is also [delicious](https://del.icio.us/) but I never gave a try. I admit it sucks for a few reasons: 

  * No tag system (i'm using Chrome)
  * You can resize the bookmark popup (Windows)
  * No search in this popup
  * The whole experience is not great
Well, to summarize : because the bookmarks system is just too damn basic. But it does the job. There is a nice platform to git clone and install ourself, to save the bookmarks and shares them automatically, it's called [Shaarli](https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli). 

# Newsletters

Easy to subscribe and forget. The emails are where I got a tons of links. I don't spend the same time on every one of them, it would be damn too time consuming! 

  * <http://highscalability.com/>: stuff-the-internet-says-on-scalability, quotes and numbers. A LOT of links to blogs and articles.
  * <http://www.confluent.io/blog/>: top quality articles about confluent platform (kafka, streams, connect..)
  * <https://scala.libhunt.com>: Scala is the best language, framework, with the best libraries ever
  * [Medium Daily Digest](https://medium.com/): I think I read 1/3 of the articles, good personal digest, technical and more worldwide news
  * [Hadoop Weekly](https://www.hadoopweekly.com/): ultra interesting for bigdata stuff, a must
  * [Pony Foo](https://ponyfoo.com/): the ponyfoo's articles are a must. the selection of the NL is quite good
  * [DB Weekly](http://dbweekly.com/): not reading everything, but interesting when i know the db
  * [Dev Tips](https://umaar.com/dev-tips/): one topic, one gif, one message. Good to know.
  * [Docker Weekly](https://blog.docker.com/docker-weekly-archives/): the docker selection is nice, the second selection, depends on the title. But i don't use it enough yet.
  * [ES.next news](http://esnextnews.com/): 5 links, by [@rauschma](https://twitter.com/rauschma)
  * [Node Weekly](http://nodeweekly.com/): quickly, to not miss any big feature
  * [Reactjs Weekly](http://reactjsnewsletter.com/): quickly going through
  * [Risingstack.com](https://blog.risingstack.com/): often quite basic and succinct, but well written
  * [Frontend Focus (previously html5 weekly)](http://frontendfocus.co/): quickly, to not miss any big feature
  * [Graphql Weekly](https://www.graphqlweekly.com/) : very quickly, graphql is graphql
  * [Data Elixir](http://dataelixir.com/): about... data as you guessed. I stopped this one. Interesting, about ML, and data in general.

# Github

I subscribed to some projects to read issues and PR and know where it’s going but it’s quite time consuming. I don’t recommend it except if you are really into open-source.

# Videos

Of course, watching conferences and courses is a must.

It’s also useful when you don’t want to read something because it’s 3am.

Often watching in 2x.

MIT OpenCourseWare
Compressor Head: (not the robot metal band!) still need to finish this series, very interesting, by Colt McAnlis
Facebook Developers: Facebook has nice conferences: Reactjs, F8, @Scale
InfoQ: mass amount of talks with slides, can find great stuff from confs and around the world
Slideshare: sometimes, you just want to get details from slides because it’s more succinct (a video is a sequence of images right?)

# Company

Professionally, Slack is very useful (even if too noisy sometimes..). Having a dedicated channel where people shares links about technology is a big plus. People likes to share, but don’t share too much, otherwise it’s lost.

# Training

Of course, personal training is essential.

I spent some time on:

Coursera: perfect when I want to get into unknown
Hackerrank: always nice a have some challenges and discover new algorithms, mostly using Scala
Pluralsight: less than coursera but I followed some stuff a while ago
Egghead: nice free videos with react, redux, cycle and so on. But not all are free.

# Books

I have a dozen of pdfs on my desktop about interesting stuff (scala, tdd, hadoop, elastic, akka, architecture, some softwares…). I’ve finished some, and started some others. Barely have time to read them.

I’m often reading a physical book aside. It’s more practical to stay focus, and “hopefully”, I have 2 hours of transit every day, so I try to not lose them.

Right now, it’s about DDD, super interesting Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software. Links and tutorials are good, but books are really useful to show us the big picture and often go deeper.

# More

Sometimes, you stumbled upon people sharing a lot of things. You keep them in case of (you ran out of things to read or do..), you never know.

A guy learning everything who wants to work at google: lots of tech and data structure names

# Why all this ?

Because I love to know lots of things. It allows you to see the greater picture of things, and know what it’s possible, where we are in the domain.

Take the Javascript arrays.

Cool we can iterate using “for”.
Then do some functional programming and use “filter”, “.map”, “.concat”.
Then in more powerful languages such as Scala or Haskell, use some monads.
Then use scalaz to use category theory over your data (and lose your mind).
Use Kafka to act as an “array container” but partitioned and distributed.
Do some streaming processing to act as your “filter”, “map” or “reduce”.
Use Spark, Flink etc. to process streams in a distributed fashion, forever.
Be reactive, and use ReactiveX (rxjs/java/scala) to have a powerful API and deal with Observables.
Use an event-driven architecture.
Don’t forget backpressure.
I see that as the whole same thing at different levels of abstraction/simplicity.

# Why it’s hard ?

Because my memory sucks and I’m sure I forget 90% of what I’m reading
Because I don’t have a lot of free time to read and learn all that. I’m trying, sleeping is overrated
Because most of things won’t be useful for me.
Because I could create stuff and write some code to make money instead

# Why it’s useful to learn all that?

Because in about a year of that, I learned SO MANY things in a lot of domains and got better overall.

# But we can’t learn everything

Despite all that, there are some domains I volontary don’t take a look, because I know it’s just too much or I know it’s just something I will never work with.

For instance:

mobile apps (except React-Native now, from far)
ops softwares (I mean chef, puppet, ansible, this kind): No problem to use them, but I don’t want to learn the internals, I just don’t care. I just love Docker. :-)
datascientism: I LOVE to work with datascientists, they are awesome people. They know the data better than anyone else in the company. But the ML piece, the Deep Learning piece is a huge world. I not the basics but it stops here. But we all should definitely learn a lot in this domain, this is the present, and it’s our future. Even Google wants to be a “ML Company First”, betting on the right horse.
design: I LOVE to work with designers, they are awesome people. Without them, we’ll still be working on green on black screens. I LOVE watch and study the work they are doing. I LOVE to criticize front-end stuff, even I have don’t have the answer.
networking: I know the basics and how to debug a bit chtefi/curated-system-tools but it’s a very complex world. I suck at understanding company’s architectures and acronyms, how it works etc.
The cloud: barely played with AWS, I want to know more, but waiting to have a use-case :)
Each job needs specialized people after all.

# Blog

As you can see, I also “maintain” this blog.

I mostly pick a topic or a framework I want to learn and share my findings. (using a lot of gists too)
It’s useful because you try to not say stupid things and must verify your affirmations. See this another blog to understand why you should write blogs.

I have a tons of drafts and titles, but it’s very hard to find time to write the articles the way you want. I often takes several evenings doing only that to make an article good enough for me. I still must improve on that part.

# Beside staying up-to-date

Don’t forget your wife, your kids, and your family.
Don’t forget yourself. Go to gym. Don’t try to be too geeky.
 

Feel free to comment about what YOU are using to stay up-to-date. I’m eagerly impatient to know.
