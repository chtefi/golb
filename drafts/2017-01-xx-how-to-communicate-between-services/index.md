\- You are in a hurry \- You want to control exactly what happens \- You don't want to commit to one framework (Lagom, see netflix ?) \- Like Flume: it tries, if it fails, it will retry It's to handle infrastructure errors, not business errors. Create 3 microservices A -> B -> C without any kind of control, just basic HTTP with a standard HTTP client call Make B or C crash. -> what happens ? -> what is the error in the frontend? (crap 500) Run another B, run another C (redundancy, load balancing, master/backup (they can act like backup, inactive the whole time except when the first C fail, B has to implement some kind of logic..), same for multiple B, and multiple A ! -> Sometimes, it's not enough. Let's say C is just slow because it timeouts trying to access an external resource : the whole stack become slow (and crash at the end): the system is overloaded for no reason. What is a circuit breaker ? \- Independent of the language (scala's, and in js for instance https://github.com/yammer/circuit-breaker-js) \- Handle infra errors gracefully (fallback to a default value, or error state) \- Timeout explicit: the service is not crashed but slow \- It simulate some kind of backpressure: the end service is slow because it's overloaded? the circuit breaker will short-circuit it and the response is will faster, and the end service will have time to recover. (but Add a circuit breaker \- Akka's impl \- Hystrix https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki/How-it-Works#circuit-breaker Tuning of the circuit breaker \- Parameters \- Exponential Backoff Monitoring of the circuit breaker opening Change to a GRPC implementation, for the sake of it (or just use that from the beginning, to see..)
